# workspace-update-todo

## Overview

This skill updates TODO items in a workspace's TODO file. It supports adding, removing, and modifying TODO items while preserving completed items.

## Steps

### 1. Workspace and TODO File

**Required**: User must specify the workspace and TODO file (or repository name).

- If workspace or TODO file is **not specified**, abort with message:
  > Please specify a workspace and TODO file. Example: `/workspace-update-todo workspace/feature-user-auth-20260116 TODO-auth-service.md`
- Workspace format: `workspace/{workspace-name}` or just `{workspace-name}`
- TODO file format: `TODO-{repository-name}.md` or just `{repository-name}`

### 2. Understand the Update Request

Determine what kind of update the user wants:

- **Add**: Add new TODO items
- **Remove**: Remove existing TODO items (only uncompleted items)
- **Modify**: Change existing TODO items (description, order, etc.)

### 3. Read Current TODO File

Read the TODO file to understand the current state:

```bash
# TODO file path
workspace/{workspace-name}/TODO-{repository-name}.md
```

### 4. Apply Updates

Apply the requested changes to the TODO file.

**Important constraints:**
- **NEVER delete completed TODO items** (items marked with `[x]`)
- Preserve the overall structure of the TODO file
- Keep completed items in their original location for history

**For adding items:**
- Add to the appropriate section
- Follow the existing format and style

**For removing items:**
- Only remove uncompleted items (items marked with `[ ]`)
- If the user requests to remove a completed item, warn them and skip it

**For modifying items:**
- Update the description or details as requested
- Preserve the completion status

### 5. Confirm Changes

After updating, summarize what was changed:

```
## TODO Updated

**File**: workspace/{workspace-name}/TODO-{repository-name}.md

**Changes**:
- Added: {count} items
- Removed: {count} items
- Modified: {count} items

**Details**:
- Added: "{item description}"
- Removed: "{item description}"
- Modified: "{old}" → "{new}"
```

### 6. Commit Workspace Snapshot

After updating the TODO file, commit the changes:

```bash
./.claude/scripts/commit-workspace-snapshot.sh {workspace-name}
```

## Example Usage

### Add a new TODO item

```
User: Add a TODO item to implement error handling in the auth module
Assistant: [Identifies workspace and repo, adds the item to the TODO file]
```

### Remove a TODO item

```
User: Remove the TODO about adding comments
Assistant: [Checks if item is completed, removes if not]
```

### Modify a TODO item

```
User: Change the priority of the testing task
Assistant: [Updates the item's position or description]
```

## Next Steps - Ask User to Proceed

After TODO update is complete, **always ask the user** whether to proceed with the next step using AskUserQuestion:

```yaml
AskUserQuestion tool:
  questions:
    - question: "TODO file updated. Would you like to proceed with executing the updated TODO items?"
      header: "Next Step"
      multiSelect: false
      options:
        - label: "Execute now"
          description: "Run /workspace-execute to work through TODO items immediately"
        - label: "Skip for now"
          description: "I'll review the changes first and execute later"
```

If the user selects "Execute now", invoke the `/workspace-execute` skill using the Skill tool.

## Notes

- Always read the TODO file before making changes to avoid conflicts
- Completed items are historical records and must be preserved
- Follow the existing formatting style in the TODO file
