# show-current-workspace

## Overview

This skill displays which workspace is currently being focused in this conversation context. No additional responses or actions.

## Steps

### 1. Identify Current Workspace from Context

Review the current conversation to determine which workspace is being worked on. Look for:

- Workspace initialized via `/init-workspace`
- Workspace specified in `/execute-workspace`, `/review-workspace-changes`, or `/create-pr-workspace`
- Any explicit workspace directory mentioned by the user

### 2. Output

Display only the current workspace path. No commentary, suggestions, or follow-up questions.

## Output Format

If a workspace is focused:

```
workspace/feature-example-20260130/
```

If no workspace is focused in this conversation:

```
No workspace focused
```

## Notes

- Output only the workspace path or "No workspace focused"
- Do not provide any additional responses, suggestions, or questions
- Do not explain what the workspace is or what to do next
- This is based on conversation context, not filesystem listing
